                Three-Body Problem is the first of a Triology called Rememberance of Earth's Past, it follows multiple different
                people over the course of many many years, it also Explores the Fermi Paradox which is the question as to why can't we find aliens?.
                The Dark Forest Theory derived by CiXin Liu answers it in a short phase, "They don't want to be found." The Dark Forest theory is one
                of the most interesting theories I have heard and feel like it might just apply to the real world.

                According to this Equation, there should be about 1000 to 100,000 civilisations in just our galaxy, however, there isnt which confuses
                many many researchers and so, we try to find a reason as to why they dont exist or why we cant find them. In the Three Body Problem book,
                It follows a researcher who was not pleased with current day society and one day stumbled upon an opportunity of a lifetime, to doom all
                of humanity

                    <h2>Common Era</h2>
                    The common era is the era where humans have not found out about the Tri-Solarians, basically current day humanity

                    <h2>Crisis Era</h2>
                    Crisis Era is the time period where humans realise that the Tri-Solarians exist and try their best to prepare for the invasion
                    ending up actually destroying the eco system and killing many humans. It also shows the Tri-Solarians using their technology to stop humanity from
                    advancing their technology

                    <h2>Deterence Era</h2>
                    Deterence Era is where humanity manages to repel the tri-solarians, but just barely, promising Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)
                    without it, humanity would have been wipped out. This is when humnaity tries to warm up and get aquainted with the Tri-Solarians.

                    <h2>Broadcast and Bunker Era</h2>
                    Broadcast and Bunker Era, it is when the Tri-Solarians backstab and betray humans, killing about 20% of their population and forcing them
                    to migrate to another place. They also managed to eliminate the MAD threat or so they thought, the escaped humans from 200 years ago before
                    the Deterence Era heard about the crsis on earth and decided to help them by broadcasting the signal

                    <h2>Galaxy Era</h2>
                    An even more advanced civilisation wipped out the Tri-Solarians in just a few years due to the broadcast which revealed humanity's and the tri-solarians
                    locations, then after another 3 or so years, an advanced civilisation comes in and uses a technology to fold the solar system from 3d into 2d which
                    basically kills everyone and everything hiding in the solar system. Only the main character and her friend escapes and eventually meet up with
                    the survivors from over 200 years ago.
