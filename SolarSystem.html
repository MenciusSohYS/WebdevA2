                Three-Body Problem is the first of a Triology called Rememberance of Earth's Past, it follows multiple different
                people over the course of many many years, it also Explores the Fermi Paradox which is the question as to why can't we find aliens?.
                The Dark Forest Theory derived by CiXin Liu answers it in a short phase, "They don't want to be found."

                It follows a researcher who was not pleased with current day society and one day stumbled upon an opportunity of a lifetime
