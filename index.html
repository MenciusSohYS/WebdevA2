                    SCIENCE FICTION
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Is a Genre fiction based on imagined future scientific or 
                    technological advances and major social or environmental changes, 
                    frequently portraying space or time travel and life on other planets.                    
                    Some Genres portray hope, like Dune or The Culture while others portray
                    nilhilism and impending doom like in Hyperion or Cthuhlu Mythos.
                    Some of my favourites would include, Warhammer 40k, Xeelee Sequence, Rememberance
                    of Earth's past, Manifold Triology, Children of Time, Cowboy Bebop and Neon Genesis Evangelion

                    Different Sci Fi use different technology and obey different laws but one thing is consistent,
                    the Kardashev scale, right now our Civilisation is at a 0.72, some Sci Fi goes as far as Types VI
                    and Type VII which is just absurd as a mere Type II is already able to harness all the power a Star
                    can offer while a Type III can harness all a Galaxy can provide. Some Sci Fi deal with different
                    explanations to the Fermi Paradox which, to put it simply is the question as to why we haven't found
                    any alien Civilisations.
