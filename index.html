                    Hi there, my name, as you can see at the top of the website, is Mencius Soh. I'm currently
                    Studying as a student in NYP, in the course C70 Game Development and Technology. I am very keen
                    on furthering my studies after I finish my national service, mainly at a local University like
                    DigiPen Institute of Technology, Nanyang Technological University or National Univeristy of Singapore

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since I was young, I played mostly mobile games as a past time during the weekends. It really astounded me
                    how games felt and played out, from the fast paced classic FPS N.O.V.A to the 2D beauty of BASTION
                    I always pondered about how games were made, what code did they have to type to create such a big
                    and diverse environment or character

                5 years into Primary School education, I decided to pick up programming, more specifically scratch. The short but memorable course was what
                solidified my interests in programming as well as game creation.
