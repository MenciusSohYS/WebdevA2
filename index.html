                    SCIENCE FICTION
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Is a Genre fiction based on imagined future scientific or 
                    technological advances and major social or environmental changes, 
                    frequently portraying space or time travel and life on other planets.                    
                    Some Genres portray hope, like Dune or The Culture while others portray
                    nihilism and impending doom like in Hyperion or Cthuhlu Mythos.
                    Some of my favourites would include, Warhammer 40k, Xeelee Sequence, Rememberance
                    of Earth's past, Manifold Triology, Children of Time, Cowboy Bebop and Neon Genesis Evangelion

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Is a story about humanity and nihilism, its about humanity panicking, destroying the earth 
                    and starving billions of lives to death. Recovering, advancing and later over
                    estimating themselves against a threat they've never seen before. Its a book about 
                    nihilism and defeatism where most of humanity go through crisis in order to live.
                    The book follows 3 people, the one who started the crisis, the one who found an unlikely solution
                    to it and the one who ultimately goes through the crisis, learn more about them <a href="SolarSystem.html">here</a>

                    Warhammer 40k
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    40k is an absurd sci fi universe with things that do not make sense at all, but thats what makes it fun, it is
                    a grim dark universe with inconsistent power scaling and feats. However, the lore is extremely diverse and multi level
                    with many loveable and relatable factions as well as some straight up evil factions. No other science fiction is as
                    popular and widely loved as warhammer 40k and it goes to show just how popular the series is. More on the other 
                    factions <a href="GalaxyBook.html">here</a>

                    Xeelee Sequence
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Xeelee Sequence is probably the bes science fiction I've ever read, it is about humanity trying to understand and rule over the universe
                    with great difficulty, getting knocked back onto their knees repeatedly in the process. If 40k was grim dark, Xeelee Sequence is straight up
                    evil, I would NOT want to be in the universe. No one in the Xeelee Sequence lives a particularly good life, all humans at the age of 10 are
                    conscripted into the army and the rest is pretty much self explanatory

                    How are they different?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Different Sci Fi use different technology and obey different laws but one thing is consistent,
                    the Kardashev scale, right now our Civilisation is at a 0.72, some Sci Fi goes as far as Types VI
                    and Type VII which is just absurd as a mere Type II is already able to harness all the power a Star
                    can offer while a Type III can harness all a Galaxy can provide. Some Sci Fi deal with different
                    explanations to the Fermi Paradox which, to put it simply is the question as to why we haven't found
                    any alien Civilisations.

                    Life on Earth is fortunate, and others may want it, like the Trisolarians in Three Body Problem. After contacting a pacfist of the
                    Trisolarians who warned Earth not to reply, the unsatisfied youngster did it anyways, offering to help the aliens to conquer Earth
                    which sent Humanity into a downward spiral, first overworking the planet to churn out military and killing most of humanity. Recovering
                    and then not developing anything for a few years, later banning and restricting technology that would've helped them in their war.

                    From Sci Fi Elves to robots 40k has almost every faction you would want, humans are Xenophobic and hate everything that is not a human, Elves come
                    in 3 flavours, down right evil, just-want-to-live and literal clowns, Necrons are robots who's souls were taken away from them, Orks who can just wish
                    anything they want into existence but are limited by their intellegence, literal human turn demons and bugs that eat everything living. They're all
                    honestly pretty flushed out and each have their best moments, each having multiple subfactions

                <div class = "bookback4" id="bookback4">
                    The massive scale of this Sci Fi cannot be understated, a viable combat tactic they used was to literally place hundreds of people in to Asteroids and catapult
                    it into deep space for about 50 generations just so that the Xeelee cant see them coming as there are billions of Asteroids in space. Lives in Xeelee are literally
                    just a resource, humans are also genetically engineered to be able to survive in space by having a symbotic relationship with aliens. Learn more about them

                This is the current place or planet has on the scale, we're about 0.7 on the Kardashev scale and have a long way to go before we're
